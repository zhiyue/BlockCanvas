<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Translating project requirements**

The user seems to be asking for a quick development of a web version of a game, specifically the Mondrian Blocks puzzle game. They’ve outlined a set of technical requirements like using React, Vite, TypeScript, and other libraries for features like drag-and-drop interactions, state management, and visual effects. It sounds like I need to start by creating a code skeleton that follows these technical choices and implements core functionalities, such as level loading and saving progress.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning shape implementation**

I’m setting up a plan before diving into coding. First, I need some clarifications, like confirming the board size of 8x8 and the 11 unique shapes. I should define those shapes' coordinates, maybe approximating them as puzzle pieces like in Rushhour. Researching the Mondrian Blocks, which feature similar polyomino shapes, could help. It might be easier to implement a generic shape representation and load definitions from a level card for simplicity. Let’s get started with the tasks!</details></think>

已为「Mondrian Blocks」网页版开发创建了详细的任务清单（14 项），涵盖从项目初始化、核心玩法实现到 PWA 离线支持与测试。  
接下来会逐步将任务状态更新为进行中并开始编码，首先从 Vite+React+TS 脚手架搭建及依赖安装开始。如果对任务拆分或优先级有任何建议，请告诉我！
